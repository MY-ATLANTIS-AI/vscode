To learn more, please see the recommended hardware resources for running CodeQL at https://gh.io/recommended-hardware-resources-for-running-codeql and the supported runners and hardware resources at https://gh.io/supported-runners-and-hardware-resources. Consider using larger runners or machines with greater resources for possible analysis time improvements.
